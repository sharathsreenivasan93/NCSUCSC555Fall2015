After unzipping the P1 folder, the user should be able to view 4 sub folders namely,
1. Graph_Characteristics
2. Hypo_1
3. Hypo_2
4. Hypo_3

a) The Graph_Characteristics folder contains the following files -
	snap_p1.py
	facebook_combined.txt
	results_p1.txt
   The code snap_p1.py is written in Python 2.7. The program should
   be executed in a Python IDE that supports Python 2.7. The path for the input file,
   (facebook_combined.txt) in this case has been hardcoded in the program. If the file
   is located in a different path, the corresponding path should be pasted in the
   appropriate locations. The results_p1.txt is the file that is generated every time
   the code is executed and is replaced if the file is previously present.

b) The Hypo_1 folder contains the python file SC_P1_a.py which is written in Python 2.7. The
   program should be executed in a python IDE that supports Python 2.7. The paths for the
   input file have been hard coded in the source code. [In this case, 0.circles, 0.edges, 
   348.circles, 348.edges]. For convenience, I have pasted the files in the same directory
   as that of the code. On execution, the source code generates a ‘hypo1.csv’ file which
   contains the outputs in the expected format. The CSV files present have been renamed so
   that the reader knows which CSV file is for which ego node. The  2 png files are
   representations of the output as a graph. The folder also contains a pdf which explains
   the output obtained.

b) The Hypo_2 folder contains the python file SC_P1_b.py which is written in Python 2.7. The
   program should be executed in a python IDE that supports Python 2.7. The paths for the
   input file have been hard coded in the source code. [In this case, 107.circles, 107.edges, 
   686.circles, 686.edges]. For convenience, I have pasted the files in the same directory
   as that of the code. On execution, the source code generates a ‘hypo2.csv’ file which
   contains the outputs in the expected format. The CSV files present have been renamed so
   that the reader knows which CSV file is for which ego node. The  2 png files are
   representations of the output as a graph. The folder also contains a pdf which explains
   the output obtained.

c) The Hypo_3 folder contains the python file SC_P1_c.py which is written in Python 2.7. The
   program should be executed in a python IDE that supports Python 2.7. The paths for the
   input file have been hard coded in the source code. [In this case, 414.circles, 414.feat, 
   414.egofeat, 698.circles, 698.egofeat, 698.feat]. For convenience, I have pasted the files
   in the same directory as that of the code. On execution, the source code generates a
   ‘hypo3.csv’ file which contains the outputs in the expected format. The CSV files present
   have been renamed so that the reader knows which CSV file is for which ego node. The  2 png
   files are representations of the output as a graph. The folder also contains a pdf which
   explains the output obtained.
